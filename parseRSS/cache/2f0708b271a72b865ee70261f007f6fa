				<img class="left" src="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/upload/2010/11/20101104_boehner_190x190.jpg"/><br /><strong>John Boehner</strong>
				<p>Yesterday House Speaker John Boehner said he wanted a <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/07/boehner_doubles_down_on_debt_c.html">working debt plan before the markets open tomorrow</a>, but perhaps that was jut a teensy bit too ambitious. Or maybe, as seems to be the case of late, he was prepared to find a passable (that is, <em>through</em> Congress) compromise but his caucus simply wasn't. Reuters now reports that Boehner is backtracking and arguing that there will have to be a <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/Reuters/status/95123026219249664">two-stage process</a>. An interesting strategy considering that President Obama, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi just yesterday reaffirmed their position that <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/07/harry-reid-no-short-term-deal-on-debt-ceiling.php">a stop-gap solution is, well, not a solution</a>. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, not particularly visible in the debt talks to date, may present the last remaining compromise on this question. Speaking to the <em>Washington Post</em> today, he said that "there's nothing wrong with doing this in stages." Just that the first stage would have to include a vote to raise the debt ceiling beyond just the next several months, while thornier debt-and-deficit-reduction plans (such as the <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/172189-coburn-rejoins-gang-of-six-backs-37t-deficit-reduction-plan">Gang of Six's much-lauded proposal</a>) could be tackled in a later phase. </p>
				<p>Geithner on CNN's "State of the Union":<br />
<blockquote>Inevitably, we&#8217;re going to do this in two stages. We&#8217;ll lock savings we&#8217;ve agreed to. And then there will be a second stage, where Congress is forced to identify and agree on a set of other reforms &#8212; tax reform that raises revenue and entitlement reform to make sure we put that on sustainable footing. But the key question is what happens at the end of that first stage.</blockquote></p>

<p><br />
That may still be a tough sell for freshmen Republicans, who are either against raising the debt ceiling full stop or want to see it used as a leveraging stick to gain huge spending concessions from the White House. In all frankness to those junior members of the House, you've been holding that negotiating chip in your hands for over a month now. And with the August 2 deadline but a week away, looks like it's time to make a final play or risk losing the whole pot. </p>

				<img class="image" src="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/upload/2011/07/20110724_GayMarriage_560x375.jpg"/><br /><strong>Phyllis Siegel, 76, and Connie Kopelov, 84; the first same-sex couple married in New York City.</strong>
				<p>The big day has arrived! At midnight last night, New York became the sixth and largest state to allow same-sex marriage. So many couples (from in and outside the state) were expected to descend on its marriage bureaus and city halls today that Mayor Michael Bloomberg even considered a lottery system to divvy out a limited number of licenses. (Read Daily Intel's plea to straight couples to "change the date" <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/07/straight_couples_please_dont_g.html">here</a>.) Thankfully the city chose to accept all <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/nyregion/across-new-york-hundreds-of-gay-couples-to-marry-on-sunday.html?_r=1&smid=tw-nytimes">823 applications for gay and straight couples alike</a>. Down on Worth St., where the city's <a href="http://gothamist.com/2009/01/08/manhattan_marriage_bureau_gets_make.php">revamped marriage bureau</a> moved to in 2009, the scene all morning has been one of calm and anticipation, based on <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/cityroom/gay-marriage">reporters' tweets collected by <em>The Times</em>' City Room</a>. <br />
</p>
				<p>As of 9:30 this morning, the line stretched from Worth St. around the corner on Centre St. ending at Hogan Place, on the other side of the City Clerk's building. A barricade kept onlookers separate and the press had its own riser across from the exit, all the better to photograph each happy couple emerging to cheering crowds. As for protesters they seemed to be a lonely bunch. Sam Dolnick, a <em>Times</em> Metro reporter, identified what he claimed was the sole protester: an Orthodox Jewish lawyer from Queens who after being <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/samdolnick/status/95115929981157376">interviewed by <em>The Daily Show</em>'s all-things-bizarre correspondent Samantha Bee</a> was <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/samdolnick/status/95120190114766849">chased off by a "rollerskating woman in sequined bra, bridal veil, and angel wings"</a>. (However an AP reporter does mention there being more protesters across from the municipal building <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chawley1/status/95110263451287552<br />
">"waving signs, many unprintable"</a>.) </p>

<p>As for who was first same-sex couple married in the state, Reuters says it was two fifty-something grandmothers at Niagara Falls, the <em>Albany Times Union</em> says a couple in Hudson, New York should take the title, and <em>The Times</em> is putting its money on an Albany pair for top honors. Below a rundown of all the "firsts" in the state. Congratulations all!</p>

<p><b>First in Niagara Falls:</b>: Buffalo natives <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/07/24/idINIndia-58420320110724">Kitty Lambert and Cheryle Rudd</a>, together for over a decade, were married by Mayor Paul Dyster at midnight on the dot, in front of their five grown children and several grandchildren and a <a href="http://www.feastoffun.com/topics/news-rumors/2011/07/24/backdrop-to-new-yorks-first-same-sex-marriage/">rainbow-colored Niagara Falls</a>, lit up just for the occasion. "Yes, yes, yes!" Lambert replied when asked if she was making the decision to marry of her own free will. Later, and oh do we love this, the couple danced onstage to Lady Gag's "The Edge of Glory." </p>

<p><b>First in Albany:</b> At the stroke of midnight, in his private chambers, Mayor Jerry Jennings married chairwoman of the city's Human Rights Commission <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/gay-marriage-in-albany-wedding-bells-ring-repeatedly/?smid=tw-cityroom&seid=auto">Barbara Laven and Dale Getto</a>, a local public school principal. (The two arrived in a white stretch Cadillac Escalade, joking, "Don't hold that against us. It's opening weekend at the [Saratoga Springs] track, so they didn't have much.) The first public marriage ceremony took place soon after at 12:16 a.m., between <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/At-last-they-say-We-do-1561623.php">Al Martino and Harold Lohner</a> who were married by State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi. Four more couples are expected to be married by Teresi and Jennings today.</p>

<p><b>First in Hudson:</b> As some 200 friends and family intently watched a clock (taped to a bamboo pole) counting down the minutes and seconds to midnight, <a href="http://www.timesunion.com/local/article/A-long-wait-ends-in-a-rush-1561571.php">Linda Mussman and Claudia Bruce</a> became wife and wife just as soon as Mayor Richard Scalera could blurt out the words, "you are legally married." By 12:03 am the couple, together for 35 years, were already feeding each other cake. </p>

<p><b>First in New York City:</b> Just two hours ago, AP reporter Chris Hawley tweeted that two lucky ladies were about to enter the city clerk's chapel and become the first same-sex couple married in New York City: <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/chawley1/status/95116860697219072">Two gray-haired seniors, Phyllis Siegel and Connie Kopolev. 1 in wheelchair."</a> Just moments earlier, Council Speaker Christine Quinn (herself openly gay) tweeted a <a href="http://yfrog.com/kl69autj">photo</a> of herself with the two brides.</p>

<p><b>First in Queens:</b> <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JimmyVanBramer/status/95118907265925120">Gregory Levine and Shane Serkiz</a> of Astoria, as tweeted by Queens Councilmember Jimmy Van Bramer. (Here's a <a href="http://yfrog.com/gyshdulbj<br />
"> photo </a> of the happy couple, in their "Sunday finest," surrounded by photographers.)</p>

<p><b>First in Buffalo:</b> Looks like we might have to wait a while longer for that one. <em>Times</em> City Hall reporter Javier Hernandez tweeted minutes ago that the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/HernandezJavier/status/95138940322971648<br />
">notary in Buffalo appears to be missing</a>. </p>

<p>And to all you other bride-on-brides and groom-on-grooms out there, have a helluva day!</p>

				<p>Yesterday House Speaker Boehner <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/07/john_boehner_pulls_out_of_debt.html">dropped out of White House debt ceiling talks</a> for the <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/07/boehner_drops_white_house_debt.html">second time</a>, and now it seems he plans to go it alone. This afternoon in a conference call with GOP lawmakers, he said he was working hard with other congressional leaders to put in place a framework for raising the debt ceiling and cutting spending by tomorrow. (Reuters cites a Republican aide who says a deal may be presented to Congress <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/07/23/us-usa-debt-republicans-aim-idUSTRE76M35U20110723">as early as Monday</a>.)</p>
				<p>Some sources claim that Boehner is considering a deal similar to the House's "Cut, Cap and Balance" plan, which has already been <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/07/as_expected_the_senate_voted_d.html">voted down</a> in the Democrat-controlled Senate. That obviously would not go over well with the White House, though the Speaker did say a larger $3 to $4 trillion deficit reduction package, that Obama had favored and that Republicans had scrapped, was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/us/politics/24debt.html?hp">back on the table</a>. So where did all this newfound energy come from? Reports coming out of Washington show a White House and Congress increasingly worried about spooking the markets, already concerned about a downgrading of America's debt if no deal is reached. The looming Sunday-Monday deadline, in particular, is specifically aimed at stabilizing the situation before the Asian markets open. Here's to hoping that the fear gripping at lawmakers' hearts will, for once, overpower their ideological stubbornness. </p>

				<p>The official Ames Straw Poll ballot was <a href="http://iowagop.org/iowagop/?p=626">released today</a>, and boy are there going to be some pissed-off Republicans. Perhaps most noteworthy is that neither Sarah Palin or Rick Perry &#8212; who just yesterday said he was <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/173125-rick-perry-expects-to-make-2012-decision-in-next-month">still mulling a presidential run</a> &#8212; were included. While the straw poll is in no way a binding vote, it is often looked to as an early bellwether of a candidate's support. And since the poll tends to favor candidates who are popular among the state's evangelical voters, this could be a pretty big missed opportunity for Perry, who was being <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304223804576448260568989824.html">seriously courted by social conservatives</a>. </p>
				<p>The other surprise was actually two names <em>included</em> on the ballot: those of ostensible front-runner Mitt Romney and (is he even still running?) Newt Gingrich. Both had declared they would sit out the affair, no doubt aware they'd place near the bottom. A valiant effort, Mitt, but looks like you'd better get to work preparing an alternative story for why Iowa Republicans just aren't that into you. And as for those die-hard Palin and Perry (or even Giuliani) fans out there in Iowa, a shred of good news: There's always the write-in option.</p>

				<img class="image" src="http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/intel/2011/07/22/22_osloexplosion.o.jpg/a_560x375.jpg"/><br /><strong>The aftermath of the explosion.</strong>
				<p>Police in Norway have arrested Anders Behring Breivik, a man who they described as a right-wing fundamentalist Christian, in the mass killing of at least 92 people with a car bomb and a killing spree at a youth camp.</p>

<p>Breivik is seen as<a href="http://m.apnews.com/ap/db_16026/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=RszNTP5m"> "right-wing" and "anti-Muslim"</a> based on views he expressed online, but seems to have no known links to Norway's underground neo-Nazi fringe. His Twitter page is free of any hate speech. That may be in part because Breivik sent his first and only tweet barely a week ago, on July 17. It ominously reads: "<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/AndersBBreivik/status/92651821369266176">One person with a belief is equal to the force of 100 000 who have only interests.</a>"</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/world/europe/24oslo.html?hp"><em>Times</em> reported</a> that "a portrait began to emerge of the main suspect in the case as a gun-loving Norwegian obsessed with what he saw as the threat of multiculturalism and Muslim immigration."<br />
</p>
				<p>According to a government spokesman, seven people were killed and at least fifteen injured by the car bomb in Oslo. Shortly thereafter, at youth Labor Party camp on an island 25 miles outside Oslo, a gunman dressed as a policeman opened fire on the group of mostly teenagers, reportedly while the kids <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ketilbstensrud/status/94487455218147330">assembled to watch the bombings on television</a>. Police now confirm <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/24/world/europe/24oslo.html?smid=tw-nytimes&seid=auto">at least 85 dead in the shooting</a>.</p>

<p>The <em>Times</em>: "Even after many made it into the water, the gunman calmly and methodically shot at those who were swimming. "</p>

<blockquote>

<p>&#8220;People right behind me were shot,&#8221; said Helen Andreassen, 21, a political adviser for the Labor Party&#8217;s youth wing. &#8220;I heard shots right behind me. He was standing just by the water, using his rifle, just taking his time, aiming and shooting. It was a slaughter of young children.&#8221; <br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>A witness told Reuters: that the killer, dressed as a policeman, "would tell people to come over: 'It's OK, you're safe, we're coming to help you.' And then I saw about 20 people come toward him and he shot them at close range." Reuters also reported that "the bloodbath was believed to be the deadliest attack by a lone gunman anywhere in modern times."</p>

<p>In Oslo, police shut down the area surrounding the bomb's targets, while a fire raged in the Oil Ministry building, sending plumes of smoke into the air above the city. Train travel from Oslo airport was suspended<a href="http://twitter.com/#!/ketilbstensrud/status/94501793110835200"> following reports of "suspicious boxes,</a>" and the city's bars and restaurants <a href="http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&prev=/search%3Fq%3Ddagbladet%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26hs%3DgY2%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-US:official%26prmd%3Divns&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=no&twu=1&u=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/07/22/nyheter/innenriks/regjeringskvartalet/17418224/&usg=ALkJrhj30J8zTRXkaUHAGpZahY8e6U8iYw">closed for the night</a>. The prime minister, whose offices were among the government buildings hit, is safe. Casualties appear to be lower than they might have been if the attack hadn't occurred this week, when many Norwegians are on vacation.</p>

<p>After initial predictions that the bombing had been carried out by an Al Qaeda affiliated group in retaliation for Norway's military participation in Afghanistan, or perhaps by an alienated Muslim immigrant, Norway is now facing the reality of a home-grown terrorist attack that bears some similarity to the Oklahoma City bombing.</p>

<p>Below, footage of the bomb's aftermath.</p>

				<p>The military hospital where President Eisenhower and General MacArthur breathed their last is officially set to close. Walter Reed, which opened in 1909, only truly became a household name in 2007 after the Washington <em>Post</em> ran a Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning series of articles detailing <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/17/AR2007021701172.html">appalling living conditions and interminable waits</a> for veterans and active troops. (The hospital treated 18,000 soldiers serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.) Care did improve soon after the articles were published, but a government commission two years ago decided that the facility was just too old to maintain. Now looks like the District of Columbia wants to turn part of the campus into a shopping center.</p>

				<p>The military hospital where President Eisenhower and General MacArthur breathed their last is officially set to close. Walter Reed, which opened in 1909, only truly became a household name in 2007 after the Washington <em>Post</em> ran a Pulitzer Prize&#8211;winning series of articles detailing <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/17/AR2007021701172.html">appalling living conditions and interminable waits</a> for veterans and active troops. (The hospital treated 18,000 soldiers serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.) Care did improve soon after the articles were published, but a government commission two years ago decided that the facility was just too old to maintain. Now looks like the District of Columbia wants to turn part of the campus into a shopping center.</p>

				<p>James Hipwell, a former business reporter at the <em>Daily Mirror</em>, today said he is prepared to testify before a parliamentary public inquiry that phone hacking at the paper was "endemic," according to <em>The Independent</em>. This just the latest development in the ever-expanding phone hacking scandal which, since <em>News of the World</em> closed down and Rupert Murdoch's bid for British broadcaster BSkyB collapsed, has been implicating more and more of News International's competitors. Foremost among them the <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/07/cnns_piers_morgan_latest_in_ph.html"><em>Daily Mirror</em> and its former editor, Piers Morgan</a>, who took over Larry King's slot at CNN earlier this year.</p>

<p>Hipwell, who worked at the paper under Piers Morgan, claims phone hacking was particularly widespread in the <em>Mirror</em>'s showbiz unit, which was located near where he and the other business reporters sat. Speaking to <em>The Independent</em>: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>They would call  a celebrity with one phone and when it was answered they would then hang up. By that stage the other phone would be into their [the celebrity's] voicemail and they would key in the code, 9999 or 0000. I saw that a lot. After they'd hacked into someone's mobile, they'd delete the message so another paper couldn't get the story.</blockquote></p>
				<p>After his name was first dragged into the fray last week, Piers Morgan went to Twitter to vigorously deny ever having okay-ed phone hacking while at the <em>Daily Mirror</em> or ever having published a story based on information retrieved through phone hacking. He even <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsJwM1DnLu4">took to Wolf Blitzer's CNN show to lambast Louise Mensch</a>, a member of Parliament who publicly pointed to a section of Piers's book where he discusses a "little trick" that sounds an awful lot like what Hipwell describes above. Granted, Piers does clarify (around the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsJwM1DnLu4">3:18 mark</a>) that in the book he only mentions knowing about the trick, not having used it &#8212; in 2007 he did call the practice an invasion of privacy when interviewed for <em>GQ</em> by supermodel Naomi Campbell. In that same interview, though, Piers did seem to go easy on many of his colleagues saying that "<a href="http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/comment/articles/2011-02/04/gq-comment-piers-morgan-naomi-campbell-interview/pictures">loads of newspaper journalists were doing it</a>" and that he believed the practice was not "as serious as planting a bug in someone's house, which is what some people think was going on." (Another highlight from that interview: Piers Morgan saying that his own phone had been hacked at the time by rival newspapers.)</p>

<p>Piers isn't the only one Hipwell is naming as a culprit: Sean Hoare, a former editor at the <em>Mirror</em>'s sister paper <em>The People</em> before moving to <em>NotW</em>. (In the spirit of full disclosure, it must be mentioned that Hipwell was fired from the <em>Mirror</em> in 2000 for buying shares in a company that the paper's business column was preparing to boost.) Now it just remains to be seen what the parliamentary inquiry makes of Hipwell's allegations and whether they will call on a certain America-bound TV personality to make an appearance in Westminster's hallowed halls. </p>

				<p>According to several sources close to the seven-term Oregon lawmaker, a voice mail was left on his office phone not long ago by a young woman claiming <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/07/rep_david_wu_accused_of_aggres.html">he'd forced her into an unwanted sexual encounter</a>. In an un-bylined article, <em>The Oregonian</em> has identified the woman as the daughter of one of Wu's high schools friends, a longtime donor to his reelection campaigns. (Some Facebook stalking by the paper's reporter reveals she may have only graduated high school in 2010.) When senior aides confronted Wu, he admitted to the sexual encounter but insisted it had been consensual, which does seem to be the go-to excuse for politicians accused of such things. While the young woman originally declined to press charges, believing it would be her word against that of a seasoned Washington pol, Wu's slate isn't exactly clean. Back in the spring of 1976, while Wu was studying premed at Stanford, he was <a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2004/10/allegation_of_assault_on_woman.html">accused by an ex-girlfriend of trying to force her to have sex with him</a>. Wu admitted to that episode as well. </p>

				<p>Just yesterday, reports indicated that a deal between President Obama and Speaker of the House John Boehner was imminent. They just had to work out some details, sell it to their respective caucuses, and call it a day. Well, those details were apparently too tough to work out. At 6 p.m. tonight, Speaker of the House John Boehner <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/boehners-letter-to-house-republicans-on-debt-talks/2011/07/22/gIQA09B9TI_blog.html">sent a letter to his fellow House Republicans</a>, announcing that he was walking away from talks with Obama altogether. He claimed that talks broke down because Obama insisted on including tax revenues and "is adamant that we cannot make fundamental changes to our entitlement programs."</p>
				<p>Minutes later, Obama addressed reporters in the White House, telling them that Boehner had turned down an "extraordinarily fair deal," one that offered more spending cuts than the bipartisan Gang of Six. "It is hard to understand why Speaker Boehner would walk away from this kind of deal," he said. "And frankly, if you look at the commentary out there, there are a lot of Republicans out there that are puzzled as to why it couldn't get done."</p>

<p>Regardless of how fair and balanced Obama considered the plan, Boehner apparently didn't think it could pass the House, where any kind of tax increase is a non-starter. So where does that leave us? Boehner, convinced that he and Obama won't be able to agree, says in his letter than he'll "begin conversations with the leaders of the Senate in an effort to find a path forward." Nevertheless, Obama has called for congressional leaders to meet with him at the White House tomorrow morning, where he expects them to "have an answer in terms of how they intend to get this thing done in the course of the next week." </p>

<p>Yes, answers would be nice. Answers would be soothing. Right now, all we have is a horrible feeling that our broken political system might drive our economy off a cliff. </p>

				<p>Just yesterday, reports indicated that a deal between President Obama and Speaker of the House John Boehner was imminent. They just had to work out some details, sell it to their respective caucuses, and call it a day. Well, those details were apparently too tough to work out. At 6 p.m. tonight, Speaker of the House John Boehner <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/boehners-letter-to-house-republicans-on-debt-talks/2011/07/22/gIQA09B9TI_blog.html">sent a letter to his fellow House Republicans</a>, announcing that he was walking away from talks with Obama altogether. He claimed that talks broke down because Obama insisted on including tax revenues and "is adamant that we cannot make fundamental changes to our entitlement programs."</p>
				<p>Minutes later, Obama addressed reporters in the White House, telling them that Boehner had turned down an "extraordinarily fair deal," one that offered more spending cuts than the bipartisan Gang of Six. "It is hard to understand why Speaker Boehner would walk away from this kind of deal," he said. "And frankly, if you look at the commentary out there, there are a lot of Republicans out there that are puzzled as to why it couldn't get done."</p>

<p>Regardless of how fair and balanced Obama considered the plan, Boehner apparently didn't think it could pass the House, where any kind of tax increase is a non-starter. So where does that leave us? Boehner, convinced that he and Obama won't be able to agree, says in his letter than he'll "begin conversations with the leaders of the Senate in an effort to find a path forward." Nevertheless, Obama has called for congressional leaders to meet with him at the White House tomorrow morning, where he expects them to "have an answer in terms of how they intend to get this thing done in the course of the next week." </p>

<p>Yes, answers would be nice. Answers would be soothing. Right now, all we have is a horrible feeling that our broken political system might drive our economy off a cliff. </p>

It's hard to know what to make of these numbers. On the one hand, some of God's support is astonishingly low. Only 71 percent are happy with how he <em>created the damn universe, from nothing, and made possible all that exists</em>? So picky, some people. </p>

<p>On the other hand, though, why does <em>anyone</em> approve of his handling of natural disasters? Those are awful, and they happen all the time. Personally, we could do with fewer natural disasters. </p>

				<p>Intel alum Tim Murphy takes to the <i>Times</i> "Style" section this weekend to explain a new phenomenon: Marriage Equality Momzillas. That is, parents who are so psyched that their queer children will be <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/07/equalrites.html">allowed to marry in New York this weekend</A> that they've begun exerting all their pent-up commitment energy on getting them to tie the knot. At last, they'll get the big frilly, flower-filled wedding they've always dreamed of. For example, Lorraine Gray has all sorts of ideas for her stepson Aaron Breslow's nuptials. "It would be very sophisticated and urban," she told Tim. "And I would do the food, which would be very foodie California: maybe a mix of Jewish, which we are, and Dominican, which [Aaron's boyfriend] Dan is. Everything would be lovely and sophisticated and not tacky." Aaron, for his part, is only 23 and &#8212; as a queer theorist &#8212; not even sure he wants to get married. But if he did, it would be a little ... different. "I want it to be really queer and outrageous and angry, with a punk-rock drag queen playing hardcore music and people being naked." </p>

<p>You know, if you think about it (and take out the queer part, the angry part, and the naked part) this kind of parent-child wedding conflict is actually rather ordinary. And isn't that the whole point?</p>
