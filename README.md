#kahub  
   
##kahub source code, the whole thing. 


kahub was a project which allowed you to share news with your friends by just highlighting any piece of text, then if your friends happend to be viewing that story, they could click your profile picture and read/reply to your comment. After we got some intial feedback, that basically it was too hard to share/people didn't read enough news to make it worth it, we pivoted a little bit and allowed you to send a post via SMS, and also broadened out to videos and photos. We allowed you to post a song by just texting us the lyrics or you could email us a photo. Neither of those things worked, so after meeting with the team, we just decided to make a bigger pivot and focus on one core attribute. Hopefully you'll be hearing more on that soon...
