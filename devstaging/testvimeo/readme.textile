h1. Vimeo API Examples

A bunch of examples for our API to help you get started.

*Note:* These are not widgets, they are intended to show you how you would use the Simple API, and oEmbed API in your own site or application. They assume that you know how to use HTML, Javascript, CSS, and PHP. We can help you if you find bugs, but we can't help you with programming or customization.

Includes examples for:
